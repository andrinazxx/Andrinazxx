#### 🦁 About Me:
- 💻 I’m currently working on a audio beamforming project on both the algorithm and the software UI design.
- 🔱 I'm a rising senior Machine Learning & Neural Computation student with a double-major in Interdisciplinary Computing Arts & Music and a minor in Computer Science & Engineering, at UC San Diego. I'll be open to work after I graduate in June 2024 and I'm available for interviews currently.
- ✨ Fun facts about me: 
  - I'm a coffee enthusiast. Mocha takes my heart.
  - I love watching lion videos / documentaries. I love comedies in diverse languages too.
  - I'm the model of my friend's graduation project and I'm my friends’ photographer when they have live performances.
  - My very first experience of working in the industry happened when I had to take my first year of college remotely. I did marketing and project management internships at GSK and Philips Lighting respectively, because I ran two fan clubs when I was in high school <3
