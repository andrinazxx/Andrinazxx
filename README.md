### Hi there 💐

### I'm Andrina 🦁

- 💻 I’m currently working on a computer vision project on film analysis, and will start on project on Geophysics data analysis again soon.
- 🔭 I’m currently learning machine learning algorithms and signal processing!
- 🔱 I'm a 3rd year Machine Learning & Neural Computation (Cognitive Science) student with a double-major in Interdisciplinary Computing Arts & Music, with a minor in Computer Science & Engineering, at UC San Diego. I'll graduate in June 2024.
- 💬 How to reach me: I'll reply DMs / give out my resumé and personal contact on LinkedIn. https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrina-zhang/ (Open web doesn't seem very safe to me regarding to my personal info🤣)
- ✨ Fun facts about me: 
  - I'm a coffee enthusiast. Mocha takes my heart.
  - I love watching lion videos / documentaries. I love comedies in diverse languages too.
  - I'm the model of my friend's graduation project and I'm my friends’ photographer when they have live performances.
  - My very first experience of working in the industry happened when I had to take my first year of college remotely. I did marketing and project management internships at GSK and Philips Lighting respectively, because I ran two fan clubs when I was in high school <3
